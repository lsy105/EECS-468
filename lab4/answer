b.
(1) If the length of the array isn't a power of two, that means the last block will be un-full. So we find the biggest number N which sastifis: N is power of 2 and N < the size of the last lock. And process the remain part with another function.
(2) We calculate the number of elements each bank holds and use this number as padding size. When we declear the shared memory, set its size to (2 * numThreadsLastBlock + (2 * numThreadsLastBlock) / NUM_BANKS)), this size can't be devided evenly by the number of banks. 

c.
The time complexity is O(n) for CPU and O(2n) for GPU.
So the theoretical performance limits is 16777216/(46/1000) = 3.6*10^8 for CPU and 2*16777216/(5.518/1000) = 6*10^9 for GPU.
The bottleneck is memory access for CPU and number of theads&blocks for GPU.
